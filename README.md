Hello,

This is a Node.js server that keeps a counter for the overall number of POST (on the root URL) requests it receives, each POST request increases the counter by 1, and when performing a GET request (on the root URL) it returns the overall number of POST requests the server has received (the counter's current value).

In order to start the server:
1. npm install
2. npm start
